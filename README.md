Overview.

For more info: http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/fofou/

Fofou (Forums For You) is a simple forum software inspired by
Joel On Software forum software (http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?joel).

It's mostly a port of FruitShow PHP forum (http://sourceforge.net/projects/fruitshow).

This is a version for App Engine, written in Python. I no longer work on it.

There's another version written in Go: https://github.com/kjk/fofou

Installation.
=============

For Google App Engine version you need to get App Engine
account and upload fofou (see
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/gettingstarted/uploading.html for
details).

Once installed, you can create one or more forums through web interface.

Design philosophy.
==================

You'll quickly see that Fofou differs in many ways from most common forum
software. There are good reasons for the differences and Joel Spolsky describes
those reason in great detail:

License.
========

The code is written completely by me and is in Public Domain.

Html/css/js files are mostly lifted from FuitShow, so they fall under
FruitShow's BSD license.
